# React-Boilerplate-v1

## Why Did I build this?
My end goal of this project is to not only create my own boilerplating react app
project that I can tailor to my needs without having to refactor the create-react-app
boilerplate, and have full control of what is inside, but also learn and implement
webpack, babel, and react. Well I also like to tinker and take things apart to see
how they work.

## What is this? How do you use it?
It is essentially a starter boilerplate for developing react projects. 

To use it, clone it down into desired directory, change the remote to a repository
of your choose, and your basically off. 
**Disclaimer** - Webpack more than likely will need configuration options, done so 
by design, to allow the user to have full control over every aspect of their project.

## Getting Started 

- Clone - to desired file directory
- Change Remote - to desired repository
- NPM I
- Check Webpack config, add, change, edit to desired settings
- CODE

## Packages - In the box :                                                                                                      
  
   - **react**: UI library for creating modular components                             
   - **react-dom**: enables us to render React within the DOM                          
   - **webpack**: bundler that converts your source code into a production-ready output
   - **webpack-dev-server**: transforms source code and serves it on a web server as it's developed continuously. Allows for output of your code in the browser
   -  **html-webpack-plugin**: an extension to webpack, adds basic index html file   
   -  **@babel/core**: Javascript based transpiler to convert modern JS into production-ready 
       version that's compatible with all web-browsers                             
   - **babel-loader**: connects Babel to webpack's build process
   - **@babel/present-env**: group of commonly used Babel Plugins bundled together, converts modern JS feautures into widely compatible syntax

## Roadmap - Future Updates
- NPM I Support - set and create an npm install script locally to save the hassle of 
needing to clone and change remotes.
